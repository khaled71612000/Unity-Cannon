# Unity Cannon

**Unity Cannon** is a project developed using the Unity game engine that demonstrates a canon shooting game. This project highlights advanced physics simulations, player control, and interactive gameplay mechanics within Unity.

### Scripts

#### CannonController.cs
- **Shooting Mechanics:** Manages the shooting functionality, including trajectory calculations and projectile launching.
- **Player Input:** Handles player input to control the canon's aiming and firing.

#### Projectile.cs
- **Physics Simulation:** Implements the physics behavior of the projectiles, including gravity and collision detection.
- **Impact Effects:** Manages the effects when projectiles hit targets.

#### TargetManager.cs
- **Target Generation:** Dynamically spawns targets in the game environment.
- **Scoring System:** Tracks and updates the player's score based on hits.

## Features

- **Realistic Physics:** Utilizes Unity's physics engine to simulate realistic projectile motion.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Engaging shooting mechanics with dynamic target generation.
- **Player Control:** Smooth and responsive controls for aiming and firing the canon.
